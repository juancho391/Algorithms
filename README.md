# Python Algorithms Practice

This repository contains a collection of Python algorithms, ranging from basic concepts to advanced techniques, such as the Kosaraju's algorithm for finding strongly connected components in a graph. The goal of this repository is to practice, enhance problem-solving skills, and learn about common algorithms used in computer science.

## Contents

- **Basic Algorithms**: Sorting (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort), Searching (Binary Search), etc.
- **Intermediate Algorithms**: Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Divide and Conquer, etc.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's, Floyd-Warshall, Kosaraju's), etc.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-algorithms-practice.git
    cd python-algorithms-practice
    ```

2. **Run any algorithm:**

    Navigate to the desired algorithm's directory and run it with Python:

    ```bash
    python algorithm_name.py
    ```

## Purpose
